\section*{KVS - Abstract Scala Data Types Key-Value Storage}
\paragraph{}
The Key-Value Database for storing scala value types. It has the simple put/get API plus some extended operation to manage the data feeds.

\section*{Backend Storage Engine}
\paragraph{}
The KVS can be backed by the various storage engines.
\begin{description}
\item[RING] For distributed, scalable, fault tolerant key-value store.
\item[LevelDB] For usage in simple non-clustered environment
\item[Memory] In memory storage for chache or testing purposes
\item[FS] Filesystem storage.
\end{description}

\section{Services Handlers}
\paragraph{}
Particular Services can operate with specific data types. Storing every specific type may require some additional logic.
You should think about the handlers as some kind of serializators/picklers/marshallers for KVS.
